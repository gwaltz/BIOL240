				This project will outline of the processes and methods organisms use to turn molecules like CO2
				and H20 into a useable format of energy like ATP. We will start at the level of a plant; and follow CO2
				and its role in photosynthesis.
				Then we will look at how the nectur produced by plants, is used by animals to create energy. </p>
			<p>
				After understanding the ways in which these organisms produce energy, we will look at how different
				abiotic and biotic factors may change the energy production processes -- what aspects of the energy
				cycle will change in
				order to sustain the production ofenergy? Knowing how energy cycles change, will allow us to observe
				these changes through experimentation.

					<p> Plants incorporates carbon dioxide from the air into sugars 
						in the nectar through the process of photosynthesis. The energy 
						required for this conversion is obtained from sunlight where ATP 
						and NADPH are produced. These energy carriers,balong with CO2, are
						then used in the light-independent reactions to synthesize sugar molecules.

							<p>When a plant takes up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and converts it into
								sugar/glucose. This process is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in
								specialized structures called chloroplasts, which is found in the leaves of a
								plant.<br><br>

								The pathway starts with the intake of CO2 from the atmosphere through tiny openings
								called stomata on the surface of the leaves. These stomata allow gases to enter and exit
								the plant. CO2 then diffuses into the cells containing chloroplasts.<br><br>

								During photosynthesis, the energy needed to convert CO2 into sugar is obtained from
								sunlight. Sunlight is absorbed by pigments called chlorophyll, located within the
								chloroplast.

							<p>
								Sunlight energy is used to generate ATP and NADPH as seen in the figure above. These
								molecules are produced through a process called photophosphorylation. The captured
								energy also splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions.<br><br>

								The ATP and NADPH generated from sunlight then move on to be used in the Calvin cycle.
								In this stage, carbon dioxide is combined with the hydrogen ions and energy from ATP and
								NADPH to produce sugar molecules. This process is known as carbon fixation and uses the
								RuBisCO enzyme to create glucose.<br><br>

					<p>To transform nectar into a usable form of energy, the hummingbird undergoes cellular resperation.
						Cellular resperation utilizes glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain,
						and oxidative
						phosphorylation to transform sugar into energy for its hovering activity. Glycolysis occurs in
						the cytoplasm, while the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation take place in the
						mitochondria. The electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These
						pathways work in together to extract energy from sugar molecules and convert it into ATP, allowing
						the hummingbird to sustain its hovering motion.</p>

							<h3>Resperatory Cycle and breakdown of food into usable energy</h3>
							<img src="Website-images/resp-cycle.1" alt="hummingbird" class="float-right"
								style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
								<p>
									Glycolysis is the initial pathway that occurs in the cytoplasm of the bird's cells. During
									glycolysis, sugar is broken down into pyruvate molecules. This process involves a
									series of enzymatic reactions and generates a small amount of ATP and NADH.<br><br>
									Krebs cycle: After glycolysis, the pyruvate molecules generated enter
									the mitochondria, where the citric acid cycle takes place. The citric acid cycle occurs
									within the mitochondrial matrix. During this cycle, the pyruvate molecules are further
									broken down, releasing carbon dioxide. The process generates NADH, FADH2, and additional ATP
									molecules.<br><br>
									Electron Transport Chain: The NADH and FADH2 molecules generated in glycolysis and the
									citric acid cycle enter the electron transport chain, which is located in the inner
									mitochondrial membrane. The ETC consists of a series of protein complexes that facilitate
									the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2. As the electrons move through the ETC,
									protons are pumped across the inner membrane, creating a proton gradient.<br><br>
									Oxidative phosphorylation is the final step in energy production
									and takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is closely connected to the electron
									transport chain. The proton gradient generated during electron transport is utilized by ATP
									synthase, an enzyme embedded in the inner membrane. ATP synthase uses the flow of protons to
									drive the synthesis of ATP, which serves as the primary energy source for cellular
									processes.<br>

					<h3 id="energy-consumption">Energy Consumption and Biotic and Abiotic Factors</h3>
					<p>By efficiently allocating their energy resources in a favorable environment, both the plant and
						the bird can ensure the optimization of their physiological processes, growth, reproduction, and
						adaptation to challenges. These energy budgeting strategies help maintain homeostasis, allowing
						them to thrive and sustain their respective life functions in their respective ecosystems.</p>
						<p>The allocation of energy by both the plant and the bird in a favorable environment is influenced by biotic and
							abiotic factors. Biotic factors refer to living organisms, such as other plants, animals, and microorganisms, while
							abiotic factors encompass non-living components like temperature, light, water availability, soil composition, and
							climate conditions.
						</p>
						<p> 
							The energy allocation of both the plant and the bird is influenced by the interactions and dynamics of biotic
							factors and abiotic factors. They must adapt and allocate their energy
							resources based on the availability of resources, competition, predators, and the challenges of the
							surrounding ecosystem. The balance between biotic and abiotic factors shapes the energy budgeting strategies of
							organisms. This ultimately influences their survival, growth, reproduction, and overall ecological interactions.

							<h3>Energy budgeting</h3>
							<p><b><u>Acquisition of Energy:</u></b><br>
						
								<b>Plant:</b> The plant will allocate a significant portion of its energy towards photosynthesis,
								capturing sunlight and converting it into chemical energy in the form of glucose.
								Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants to generate their own food.<br><br>
						
								<b>Bird:</b> The bird will allocate its energy towards foraging and acquiring food. It will engage
								in activities such as searching for nectar, insects, or seeds to obtain the necessary
								nutrients and energy it needs for its metabolic processes.<br><br>
						
								<b><u>Maintenance and Growth:</u></b><br>
						
								<b>Plant:</b> The plant will allocate energy towards maintaining its physiological functions, such as cellular
								respiration,
								water uptake, nutrient absorption, and transport. Additionally, it will allocate energy towards growth,
								including the
								development of roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive structures.<br><br>
								<b>Bird:</b> The bird will allocate energy towards maintaining its basic bodily functions, such as respiration,
								digestion,
								circulation, and thermoregulation. Energy will also be allocated towards growth and maintenance of feathers,
								muscles, and
								organs.<br><br>
						
								<b><u>Reproduction:</u></b><br>
						
								<b>Plant:</b> The plant will allocate energy towards reproductive processes, including the production of
								flowers, fruits, and
								seeds. This allocation ensures successful pollination, fertilization, and dispersal of offspring to propagate
								the
								species.<br><br>
								<b>Bird:</b> The bird will allocate energy towards reproductive behaviors, such as courtship displays, mating,
								and
								nest-building. Energy will also be invested in egg production, incubation, and caring for the young
								birds.<br><br>
						
								<b><u>Adaptation to Environmental Challenges:</u></b><br>
						
								<b>Plant:</b> The plant will allocate energy towards defense mechanisms against environmental challenges, such
								as producing
								chemical compounds to deter herbivores or developing physical adaptations like thorns or tough leaves to resist
								predation or extreme weather conditions.<br><br>
								<b>Bird:</b> The bird will allocate energy towards adaptations that enhance its survival, such as flight for
								efficient foraging
								and evading predators. Energy will also be directed towards maintaining body temperature, especially in
								fluctuating
								environments, through activities like preening and fluffing feathers.
							</p>
							<h3>Abiotic and Biotic Factors</h3>
							<p>
								<b><u>Biotic Factors:</u></b><br>
								<b>Plant:</b> The plant's energy allocation is influenced by interactions with other organisms. For example, competition for
								resources, such as sunlight, water, and nutrients, from neighboring plants may affect the plant's energy allocation
								towards growth and reproduction. The presence of pollinators and their efficiency in transferring pollen may influence
								the plant's allocation towards reproductive efforts.<br><br>
								<b>Bird:</b> The bird's energy allocation can be influenced by biotic factors such as food availability, competition with other
								bird species for resources, and interactions with predators. The presence of preferred food sources, such as nectar-rich
								flowers or abundant insect populations, will impact the bird's energy allocation towards foraging and reproduction.
								Interactions with other birds, such as territorial disputes or cooperative behaviors, can also influence energy
								allocation.<br><br>
								<b><u>Abiotic Factors:</u></b><br>

								<b>Plant:</b> Abiotic factors play a significant role in energy allocation for plants. Sunlight availability determines the
								energy available for photosynthesis, influencing the plant's allocation towards growth and reproduction. Water
								availability affects the plant's ability to perform essential physiological processes and allocate energy towards
								maintaining turgidity, nutrient transport, and osmoregulation. Soil composition, nutrient availability, and temperature
								also impact the plant's energy allocation for growth and defense mechanisms.<br><br>
								<b>Bird:</b> Abiotic factors such as temperature, light availability, and weather conditions influence the bird's energy
								allocation. Temperature affects metabolic rates and energy expenditure for thermoregulation. Light availability impacts
								foraging efficiency and activity patterns. Weather conditions, such as rainfall or extreme temperatures, can influence
								the bird's energy allocation towards seeking shelter or adapting behavior to ensure survival.

							<p><b>Hypothesis: </b>The challenge of shade would negatively impact photosynthesis, cellular
								respiration, and homeostasis (energy balance) in both the plant and the bird.<br><br>
								<b><u>Impact on Photosynthesis:</u></b><br>
								In shade, the availability of sunlight decreases, which directly affects the plant's ability to undergo photosynthesis.
								Reduced light intensity leads to a lower rate of photosynthesis in the plant, as it is unable to capture sufficient
								light energy for the process. This, in turn, would limit the production of glucose, the primary energy source for both
								the plant and the bird.<br><br>
								<b><u>Impact on Cellular Respiration:</u></b><br>
								With reduced photosynthesis, there would be a decrease in the production of glucose in the plant. As a result, the plant
								would have limited carbohydrates available for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration, which is the process by which
								cells generate ATP, would also be impacted. The reduced availability of glucose would lead to a decrease in ATP
								production, negatively affecting energy availability for metabolic processes in both the plant and the bird. Birds wil
								also need to spend more energy to find more flowers due their decresed production. <br>
								<b><u>Impact on Homeostasis:</u></b>
								The reduced energy availability due to limited photosynthesis and cellular respiration would disrupt the energy balance
								and homeostasis in both the plant and the bird. The plant may experience decreased growth, development, and reproduction
								due to insufficient energy reserves. Similarly, the bird may face challenges in meeting its energy requirements for
								maintaining bodily functions, flight, foraging, and reproduction.<br>
							</p>
							<h3>Experiment:</h3>
							<p>
								To test the hypothesis, an experiment could be designed to compare the physiological responses of plants and birds in
								shaded versus non-shaded environments. <br><br>
	
	
								<b><u>Plant Study:</u></b><br><br>
							   
								-Select two groups of identical plant species, with one group placed in a shaded area and the other group in a well-lit
								area.<br>
								-Monitor and measure parameters such as photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, growth rate, and carbohydrate levels in
								both groups over a specific time period.<br>
								-Analyze physiological indicators such as stomatal conductance, respiration rate, and water potential to
								assess the overall health and homeostasis of the plants.<br><br>
	
	
								<b>Bird Study:</b><br><br>
							   
								-Choose two groups of similar bird species, with one group exposed to shade and the other group in a well-lit area.<br>
								-Observe and record behaviors related to foraging, flight activity, and reproductive behaviors in both groups.<br>
								-Measure physiological parameters such as metabolic rate, body temperature, energy expenditure, and body condition over a
								specific period of time.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b><u>Results:</u></b><br>

								-In the plant study, the shaded group would exhibit lower photosynthetic rates, reduced growth, decreased chlorophyll
								content, and lower carbohydrate levels compared to the well-lit group.<br>
								-In the bird study, the shaded group would show decreased foraging activity, reduced flight performance, altered
								metabolic rates, and potentially lower body condition compared to the well-lit group.
